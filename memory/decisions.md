# Decisions

**Architectural choices and rationale.**

---

<!-- Add decisions here when making significant architectural choices -->

<!-- Example format:
## 2026-02-09: 5 agents instead of 8

**Decision:** Use 5 agents (research, prototype, implementation, validation, documentation) instead of legacy 8 agents.

**Rationale:**
- Simplicity first: 5 agents cover all milestone phases
- Reduces always-on context (~200 lines saved)
- Clear separation of concerns

**Trade-offs:**
- Less specialization (legacy had separate agents for measurement setup vs. analysis)
- More combined skills per agent

**Outcome:** Passed validation, ~75% context reduction vs. legacy.
