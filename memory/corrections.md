<!-- Example format:
## 2026-02-09: Incorrect CPU estimate for biquad cascade

**What happened:** Research agent estimated 10 cycles per biquad, but actual measurement showed 20 cycles.

**Why it matters:** Underestimating CPU usage leads to incorrect feasibility assessments.

**Correction:** Use 20 cycles per biquad as baseline for STM32H562.

**Impact:** Update `dsp-embedded-constraints/stm32h562-spec.md` with correct estimates.
