summary: Background agents hid progress; /feedback asked instead of analyzing
---

## What Happened

User ran `/milestone-review` to generate the QuickTune milestone package. Agent spawned validation and documentation agents with `run_in_background: true`, which hid all progress from the user. User had to ask "Is it done? Why running background?" to get visibility. Additionally, when user invoked `/feedback`, agent asked an open-ended question ("What feedback would you like to capture?") instead of proactively analyzing the session for friction as the command specifies.

## Root Cause

Agent-side decision error on two fronts: (1) Chose background mode for parallelism without considering that user-invoked commands require visible progress. Background mode is appropriate for internal sub-tasks, not top-level user requests. (2) Did not follow the `/feedback` command's Phase 1-3 protocol (silent analysis, then propose diagnosis). Instead fell back to generic question-asking behavior.

## Suggested Fix

1. For user-invoked commands (`/milestone-review`, `/validate`, etc.), always run agents in foreground — never use `run_in_background: true`.
2. `/feedback` must always auto-analyze the session first (Phases 1-3), then present a diagnosis for confirmation. Never ask open-ended "what feedback?" questions.
